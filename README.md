# Crystal Collector

The Crystal Collector game is a Javascript-based app that involves collecting crystals that hold a random value that accumulate toward a target number without going over the target number.

### Rules
* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a hidden, preset amount of points to the player's total score. Although the amount of each crystal is hidden to the player, as the total score is updated, it reflects the value of that crystal.
* The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number.
* The player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.
* If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.
* When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.
